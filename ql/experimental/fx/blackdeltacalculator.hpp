            Computes the strike price that corresponds to "at-the-money" under different conventions
            commonly used in FX markets. This method does not require an explicit strike input
            as it determines the ATM level based on the specified convention.
            
            \param atmT The ATM convention to use:
                       - AtmNull: No ATM convention (returns null)

                       - AtmForward: ATM strike equals the forward rate

                       - AtmVegaMax: ATM strike that maximizes vega (typically close to forward)
                       - AtmGammaMax: ATM strike that maximizes gamma
                       - AtmPutCall25: ATM strike where 25-delta call and put have equal volatility
            
            \return The ATM strike price according to the specified convention.
            
            \note This calculation is independent of the strike and uses the forward rate,
                  volatility, and time to expiration set at construction.
