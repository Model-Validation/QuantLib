========================================
Inequality Constraint Bug Demonstration
========================================

Data points:
  (0, 0)
  (1, 1)

Constraint: y(0.5) >= 0.7
Natural value without constraint: y(0.5) = 0.5

Using CubicInterpolation (for comparison):
  y(0.5) = 0.5

Expected with constraint y(0.5) >= 0.7:
  Hard mode: y(0.5) = 0.7 (constraint active)
  LS mode: y(0.5) = 0.7 (constraint satisfied)

Actual (from Python tests):
  Hard mode: y(0.5) = 0.0 - CONSTRAINT VIOLATED!
  LS mode: y(0.5) = 0.7 - Constraint satisfied

========================================
The bug: Hard mode ignores inequality constraints
