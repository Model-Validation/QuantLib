B-Spline Flow Test - Quadratic with Inequality
========================================

1. Segment created:
   Degree: 2
   Simple knots: 0 1 
   Knot indices: 0 0 0 1 1 1 
   Variables: 3 (should be 3 for quadratic)

2. Basis functions:
   At x=0: B0=1 B1=0 B2=0 
   At x=0.5: B0=0.25 B1=0.5 B2=0.25 
   At x=1: B0=0 B1=0 B2=1 

3. Creating inequality constraint y(0.5) >= 0.7:
   Basis at x=0.5: B0=0.25 B1=0.5 B2=0.25 
   Constraint in SCS form: A[0,0]=-0.25 A[0,1]=-0.5 A[0,2]=-0.25 b[0]=-0.7

4. Creating SplineConstraints:
   Constraints created with 1 inequality

5. Creating BSplineStructure:
   Structure created

6. Test Case 1: Minimal interpolation (underdetermined)
   Data points: (0,0) (1,1) 
   This creates an underdetermined system:
     - 3 variables (c0, c1, c2)
     - 2 interpolation constraints (f(0)=0, f(1)=1)
     - 1 inequality constraint (f(0.5)>=0.7)
   The inequality should guide the solution

   Calling interpolate...
   Interpolation succeeded

   Solution coefficients:
     c[0] = 1.14552e-12
     c[1] = -4.59634e-05
     c[2] = 1.14552e-12

   Evaluation:
     f(0) = 1.14552e-12
     f(0.5) = -2.29817e-05 (constraint: >= 0.7) [FAIL]
     f(1) = 1.14552e-12

7. Test Case 2: With 3 interpolation points
   Data points: (0,0) (0.5,0.5) (1,1) 
   This would naturally give f(0.5)=0.5
   But inequality requires f(0.5)>=0.7
   System is overdetermined - should fail or adjust
