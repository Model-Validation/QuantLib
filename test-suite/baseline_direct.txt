Direct SplineConstraints Test
========================================

Test 1: Only inequality constraint -c[1] <= -0.7
========================================
Creating constraints with:
  Variables: 3
  Inequalities: 1
  Constraint: -c[1] <= -0.7
Constraints created successfully
  Total constraints: 1

Solving...
Solution found!
  c[0] = 0
  c[1] = 0.7
  c[2] = 0

Constraint check: -c[1] = -0.7 <= -0.7? YES


Test 2: Mixed constraints
========================================
Constraints in SCS order:
  EQ0: c[0] = 0
  EQ1: c[2] = 1
  INEQ0: -c[1] <= -0.7

Creating mixed constraints:
  Variables: 3
  Equalities: 2
  Inequalities: 1
Constraints created successfully
  Total constraints: 3

Solving mixed system...
Solution found!
  c[0] = 0
  c[1] = 0.7
  c[2] = 1

Constraint checks:
  c[0] = 0 (should be 0): OK
  c[2] = 1 (should be 1): OK
  c[1] = 0.7 >= 0.7? OK
